Alluvia Chocolate is a handcraft bean-to-bar chocolates brand made by a two-generation family in Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Together we design a brand new identity inspired from the Mekong essence. Based in Vietnam's fertile Mekong Delta region, Alluvia creates bean-to-bar chocolates using local cacao. They wanted branding that celebrated their Vietnamese heritage and communicated their commitment to quality and innovation.

I designed a new visual identity inspired by the lush alluvium landscapes formed by the Mekong River. Earthy colors and organic shapes reflect the brand's ties to the land. Typography-driven packaging establishes a contemporary, upscale feel.

At the heart of the new logo is the Vietnamese cacao pod, stylized as an A for Alluvia. Script lettering adds an artisanal touch. Throughout the branding, I integrated local symbols, patterns, and illustrations to honor Alluvia's origins.

The end result provides Alluvia with an elevated yet authentic brand identity deeply rooted in their home region. I loved helping reshape the visuals to better convey their family's chocolate-making legacy and pride in Vietnamese cacao.
