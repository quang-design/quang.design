When specialty coffee shop Suda Coffee LLC approached me to develop their brand identity, they wanted to share authentic Vietnamese-style coffee with New Yorkers in a way that would stand out from other coffee companies. Sourcing premium beans from Vietnam, Suda Coffee's mission is to provide an immersive, cultural coffee experience rooted in Vietnamese traditions.
