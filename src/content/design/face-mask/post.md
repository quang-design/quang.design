When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, there was an urgent need for supplies like disposable face masks to be produced and shipped quickly. I was brought on by manufacturer Kinh Bac - Thanh Nam Joint Stock Company to design packaging that would get their masks to people efficiently.

With only 2 days to deliver due to the pressing timeline, I came up with a streamlined design that organized all the necessary information in a clean, legible way. The front of the package features a large photo of the mask along with key details like "3-ply" and "BFE ≥ 95%" to showcase the quality and filtration effectiveness. The Vietnamese company name and brand are also prominently displayed.
