full-stack learning path  
react framework, codecademy  
project "jammming" - basic app

front-end going great  
everything just works

it's back-end time!

Spotify API, auth, access token, callback  
wrong redirect uri, it doesn't work  
correct uri but it's localhost, it doesn't work  
ngrok http 3000, it doesn't work  
deployed on vercel, it doesn't work  
missing a trailing slash (fuck! now i can feel it),  
it's â€¦ still not work  
correct uri, with trailing slash, it doesn't work

got frustrated and quit  
then coming back after a while,

it works!  
wtf i don't get it  
it works!!

so things take time  
and it works!!!
