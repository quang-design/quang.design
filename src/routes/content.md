### Xin ChÃ o! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Quang - a Vietnamese Graphic Designer skilled at crafting impactful brand identities. My goal is to deeply understand your vision and translate it into resonating visuals like branding system, naming, brand story & messaging.

Deeply curious about technology, I started learning web development and deep learning a year ago.

Currently, I'm in an exciting experimental phase, exploring NLP and other fascinating areas of tech.

Feel free to reach out to me at [xinchao@quang.design](mailto:xinchao@quang.design) if you'd like to discuss design, branding, technology, or simply chat about the beauty of the color black! Happy to connect with y'all.
